# Coin-Card
Optimization scripts to generate a 3d printable card to hold coins.

## Problem Description
I have the [Arceo wallet](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roninenergetics/arceo-wallet-the-premiere-magnetic-carry-system), which has no nice solution for coins. I wanted a way to carry coins that minimized noise and wasted space, without compromising on the values I could make. Canada got rid of the penny, and the smallest bill is $5, so I wanted to make every multiple of 5 cents up to $5.

## Example Code

Example code for generating the SCAD and SVG files is in the file `test.jl`.
